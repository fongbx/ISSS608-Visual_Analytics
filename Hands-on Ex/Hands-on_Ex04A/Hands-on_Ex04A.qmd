# Overview

We already understood some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution, like histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plots and how they can be created using ggplot2. In this exercise, we will learn two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot using ggplot2 and its extensions.

# Getting Started

## Import and Launch R Packages

The following packages will be used in this exercise:

-   **tidyverse** - a family of R packages for data science process,
-   **ggridges** - a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, and
-   **ggdist** - for visualising distribution and uncertainty

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggridges, ggdist, ggthemes, colorspace)
```
