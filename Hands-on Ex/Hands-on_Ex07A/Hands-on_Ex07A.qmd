# Overview

By the end of this hands-on exercise, we will be able create the following data visualisations by using R packages:

-   plotting a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions,
-   plotting a cycle plot by using ggplot2 function,
-   plotting a slopegraph
-   plotting a horizon chart

# Getting Started

## Install and Launch R Packages

We will use the following packages for this exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(scales, viridis, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, readxl, knitr, data.table, CGPfunctions, ggHoriPlot, tidyverse)
```

## Load Data

We will use *eventlog.csv* file for this exercise.

```{r}
attacks <- read_csv("data/eventlog.csv")
```

We will examine the loaded data below. The function *kable()* can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.

```{r}
kable(head(attacks))
```
