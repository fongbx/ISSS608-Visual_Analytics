<p>This exercise references the <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/MC2.html">Mini-Challenge 2</a> of VAST Challenge 2023. The objective of the exercise is to help FishEye International identify companies possibly engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through analysis of patterns in trade data.</p>
<p>We will focus on task 1 in the mini-challenge, which is to use visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records. We will also attempt to categorise the types of business relationship patterns found.</p>

<li>Summarising one set of edge dataset <em>mc2_edges_agg</em> with the weights based on the frequency of trades between the source and target, and another set of edge dataset <em>mc2_edges_agg_year</em> with the weights based on the frequency of trades between the source and target and by year.

Key Observations
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The nodes with many frequent trade partners (i.e., high degree centrality on the Frequent Trade Relationship Network) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caracola del Sol Services</strong> (with 13 frequent trade partners)</li>
<li><strong>Pao gan SE Seal</strong> (with 10 frequent trade partners)</li>
<li><strong>Sea Breezes S.A. de C.V. Freight</strong> (with 8 frequent trade partners)</li>
</ul>
<p>As these entities have many established connections and engage in extensive trade activities, they could likely be identified as the <strong>key players or influential actors in the trade network</strong>.</p>
<p>Further analysis (not covered in this exercise) can potentially explore the nature of the trade relationships of these entities, including the types of goods traded (based on <em>hscode</em>), the geographical regions involved (based on <em>shpcountry</em> and <em>rcvcountry</em> of partners) and the duration and stability of the trade relationships. Such analyses can provide further insights into the dynamics of trade patterns.</p>

Key Observations

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We observe that trade partners with the most number of trades may not be the most stable ones. For example, between the trade partners <strong>nián yú Ltd.&nbsp;Corporation</strong> and <strong>Costa de la Felicidad Shipping</strong>, although they have high frequency of trade in 2028 and 2029, the trades start to dwindle from 2030 onwards and in 2034, there were no longer any trades between them.</p>

Key Observations
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The nodes with many regular trade partners (i.e., high degree centrality on the Regular Trade Relationship Network) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mar del Este CJSC</strong> (with 18 regular trade partners)</li>
<li><strong>Caracola del Sol Services</strong> (with 8 regular trade partners)</li>
<li><strong>hǎi dǎn Corporation Wharf</strong> (with 8 regular trade partners)</li>
</ul>
<p>As these entities have many established and stable trade relationships within the network, they could likely be identified as the <strong>preferred trading partners</strong>.</p>
<p>Further analysis (not covered in this exercise) can potentially explore the understanding of the role of these entities within the value chain (i.e., whether they act as suppliers of distributors) and the geographical region that they are active in (based on <em>shpcountry</em> and <em>rcvcountry</em> of partners). Understanding their position in the value chain and active geographical region can help to assess their influence on the flow of goods and services and their impact on the overall trade ecosystem.</p>

<p>Most of the regular trade partners have fairly consistent trade volume over the years. The exception is between the trade partners <strong>Sea Breezes S.A. de C.V. Frieght</strong> and <strong>Caracola del Sol Services</strong>, which saw a spike in number of trades in 2030 and 2031. The reasons for the spike are not known and further analyses (not covered in this exercise) can be done to investigate into such patterns.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we want to understand which are the intermediaries in the trade network. This refers to the nodes with high betweenness centrality. Understanding intermediaries can be potentially help in the identification of illegal fishing activities as they act as middlemen or facilitators in trade transactions between other entities.</p>
<p>We will extract the <strong>entities with the top 10 highest betweenness centrality (i.e., top 10 intermediaries)</strong> using the code chunk below.</p>

<p>The top 10 intermediaries, in order from highest to lowest between centrality, are the following:</p>

<li><strong>Costa de Oro S.p.A.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Playa de la Felicidad Ltd Consultants</strong></li>

<li><strong>xiǎo lóng xiā NV</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tamil Nadu SE Carriers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aqua Aura SE Marine life</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As these entities play a role in <strong>connecting entities involved in trade</strong>, we can analyse the trade relationships and transactions involving the intermediaries further to see if we can identify any suspicious patterns such as sporadic or unusual trade volumes.</p>

<p>The intermediary <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> plays a more active role in receiving rather than delivery of fish trades. Over the years, the number of trade partners seemed to fluctuate quite a bit, indicative that the entity has some sporadic trade partners.</p>

<p>Given the understanding that <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> plays a more active role in receiving rather than delivery of fish trades, we will deep five further into the trades in which <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> is a recipient (i.e., we will examine the trades from the multiple source entities to <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong>).</p>
<p>The following is a time series plot to see how the trade frequency from these source entities to <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> change over the years.</p>

Key Observations
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Among the source partners of <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong>, there are quite a few entities with similar names. We will isolate the trades of <strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> with some of these entities and describe the observed trends below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Limited Liability Company</strong> and <strong>4 Limited Liability Company Seaport</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> has only 2 trades with <strong>2 Limited Liability Company</strong> in 2029. Following which, it started trading with <strong>4 Limited Liability Company Seaport</strong> between 2031 and 2034</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kerala Market Plc Transport</strong> and <strong>Kerala Market Sp United</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>David Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Forwading</strong> has only 5 trades with <strong>Kerala Market Plc Transport</strong> in 2028. Following which, it started trading with <strong>Kerala Market Sp United</strong> between 2029 and 2030</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We understand from FishEye that one observed trend is that companies caught fishing illegally will shut down and then often start up again under a different name. The abovementioned entities could have suspicions of such behaviour as their trade activities are sporadic and when activities of one entity ceases, activities with another entity of similar name appears.</p>
<p>Further analysis (not covered in this exercise) can drill in further to these trade partners of the intermediaries and analyse their trade patterns and behaviour. We can also look into other red flags of illegal fishing including analysing whether there are any abnormal patterns relating to traded value or traded weight.</p>
