<p>Currently, the financial data is in long format, with <em>participantId</em> repeated across the rows for each timestamp and category of financial transaction. For more meaningful analysis of the financial data by participants, we will prepare the data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate the total amount for each category of financial transaction for each <em>yearmonth</em> for each participant using <code>group_by()</code></li>
<li>Narrow down to the necessary columns using <code>select()</code></li>
<li>Convert the data from long to wide format using <code>pivot_wider()</code> to pivot the data frame so that the <em>category</em> column becomes the names of the new columns, the <em>amount</em> column becomes the values in those columns, and the values are summed up for each <em>participantId</em> and <em>yearmonth</em> combination</li>
<li>Replace all NA values with 0 using <code>replace(is.na(.), 0)</code></li>
<li>Compute a new variable <em>AdjustedShelter</em> to offset the <em>Shelte</em>r expenses with the <em>RentAdjustments</em> (considered as relief received in relation to Shelter expenses) using <code>mutate()</code></li>
<li>Change all expense category (including <em>Education, Food, Recreation</em> and <em>AdjustedShelter</em>) to positive amounts for easier analysis and visualisation using <code>mutate(across())</code> the columns and applying the function to multiply with -1 and round to two decimal places</li>
<li>Compute a new variable <em>CostOfLiving</em> to facilitate analysis of a participant’s total expenses using <code>mutate()</code></li>
<li>Select the final required variables using <code>select()</code></li>
<li>Finally, we will use the <code>ungroup()</code> function to remove the groupings with our <code>group_by()</code> function to avoid any potential unintended errors due to the grouping</li>

<p>Having noted that a large proportion of the residents do not have children, we want to investigate further into the factors that potentially have a relationship with whether a resident has kids or not. One hypothesis we have is that a resident’s education level could be related to whether or not he or she has kids. We will hence want to perform a test of independence with the following hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>H0: There is no relationship between education level and having kids<br>
H1: There is a relationship between education level and having kids</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The test we will be using is the Pearson’s chi-squared test. We will use <a href="https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html"><code>ggbarstats()</code></a> from the <strong>ggstatsplot</strong> package to generate the plot and the statistical test results below.</p>

<p>As the p-value from the Pearson’s chi-squared test is higher than our level of significance of 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is insufficient evidence to show that there is a relationship between a resident’s education level and whether or not he or she has kids.</p>

<ul>
<li>The income distribution is positively-skewed, with a right tail. This tells us that the majority of the population has lower income, with fewer individuals earning higher incomes.</li>
<li>The presence of outliers on the right also indicate that there are some extreme high-income earners that are relatively rare in the population.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will further plot the Lorenz curve below using <code>stat_lorenz()</code> from the <strong>gglorenz</strong> package, which is a more mathematical graphical representation of the spread of income over a population. At any point in the Lorenz curve, we can find a cumulative percentage of the population and see how much of the cumulative share of income they hold. The shaded area between the Lorenz curve and the straight diagonal line, which represents perfect equality in income distribution, is the Gini Coefficient. A Gini Coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents highest inequality.</p>

<p>In the City of Engagement, the Lorenz curve deviates slightly from the straight diagonal line and the Gini Coefficient is 0.27. As a guideline, a Gini Coefficient value between 0.2 - 0.3 represents relative equality. This shows that overall, there did not seem to be an issue of big income gap. It might however still be worth looking into whether income differs by any particulars groups of demographic profiles.</p>

<p>We now want to drill in further to understand how income and the different expense categories differ by the different demographic profiles. For such exploration, we will use an interactive chart created with <code>plot_ly()</code> from the <strong>plotly</strong> package.</p>

<ul>
<li>Income seems to differ across residents of different education levels. Particularly, the income of residents with Graduate degree seem to be the highest, followed by residents with Bachelors degree, then residents with Low or High School or College.</li>
<li>For residents who have kids and have higher household sizes, the expenses that seem to make a difference are education and shelter expenses. Particularly, it is noted that only residents who have kids (and hence household size 3) bear the costs of education expenses. Shelter expenses also seem to be higher for residents who have kids and with bigger household sizes.</li>

<p>We want to confirm our hypothesis of whether income differs by education level and test the following hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>H0: Median of income is equal across education levels<br>
H1: Not all medians are equal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We first check the normality of the income distribution by education levels by plotting the Q-Q Plots and performing the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test using <code>shapiro_test()</code> from the <strong>rstatix</strong> package. As the p-values from the normality tests are less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the distributions are normally distributed.</p>

<p>As the p-value from the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test is less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the median income is equal across all education levels. Pairwise test further confirmed that median income differs between all pairs of education levels, with Graduates having the highest median income, followed by Bachelors, High School or College, then the residents with Low education level.</p>

<p>As the p-value from the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test is less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the median shelter expense is equal across all household sizes. Pairwise test further confirmed that median shelter expenses differs between all pairs of household sizes, with residents having household size 2 having the highest median shelter expense, followed by household size 3, then household size 1.</p>
<p>Together with the earlier observation from the interactive boxplots that only residents who have kids (and hence household size 3) bear the costs of education expenses, the city managers may consider more reliefs on education and shelter expenses for families who have kids and bigger household sizes. This is especially considering that only about 28% of the population have kids and such reliefs could help to reduce some of the expense burden for families who wish to have kids.</p>

<p>Other than looking at the income and expenses for the whole period, we also want to understand how the residents’ income and cost of living, which is defined as the sum of all expenses including shelter, education, food and recreation, have changed over time. This is to find out whether there is any concern of cost inflation without commensurate increase in income. We can visualise this through the ridgeline plot below, plotted using <code>stat_density_ridges()</code> from the <strong>ggridges</strong> package.</p>

Key Observations

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li>In Mar 2022, the median wage is much higher compared to the other months. The entire distribution of wage is also to the right of the distributions in other months, indicating that the wage anomaly in Mar 2022 applies to most in the population and not just specific individuals. As the City of Engagement serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city, it could be that the March period is harvest month and hence the period when there is a big increase in wage.</li>
<li>Other than Mar 2022, the distribution of wage and cost of living for the other months seem to remain quite consistent over the months. There did not seem to be an issue of inflation of costs during this period.</li>
<li>For all the months, the distribution of wage falls on the right of the distribution of cost of living, meaning that income amounts are generally higher than cost of living, and most the population should still have savings every month.</li>
<li>The distribution of wage is more widely spread out compared to the distribution of cost of living, meaning there is greater divergence in income compared to spending in the population.</li>

<p>Jovaility seems to differ by education level and the interest group that a resident belongs to. On the other hand, factors like age groups, whether a resident has kids or the household size do not seem to play a big difference to joviality.</p>

<p>We want to confirm our hypothesis of whether joviality differs by education level and test the following hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>H0: Median of joviality is equal across education levels<br>
H1: Not all medians are equal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We first check the normality of joviality by education levels by plotting the Q-Q Plots and performing the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test. As the p-values from the normality tests are less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the distributions are normally distributed.</p>

<p>Given that our the distribution is not normal, we will use the non-parametric test that does not assume normality for our hypothesis testing. In this case, we will be performing the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test.</p>

<p>As the p-value from the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test is less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the median joviality is equal across all education levels. Pairwise test tells us that median joviality is higher in the Bachelors and Graduate group compared with the group with High School or College or Low education level. The correlation however does not indicate causality and it is worth exploring further into such observed patterns.</p>

<p>Next, we will confirm our hypothesis of whether joviality differs by interest groups and test the following hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>H0: Median of joviality is equal across interest groups<br>
H1: Not all medians are equal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We first check the normality of joviality by interest groups by plotting the Q-Q Plots and performing the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test. As the p-values from the normality tests are less than our level of significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the distributions are normally distributed.</p>
