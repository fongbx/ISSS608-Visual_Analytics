In this exercise, we will learn two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Import and Launch R Packages\n\nIn this exercise, we will use the following R packages:\n\n-   **tidyverse** - a family of R packages for data science process,\n-   **ggridges** - a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, and\n-   **ggdist** - for visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes, colorspace)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Import Data\n\nWe will use `Exam_data.csv` for this exercise.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\n\n***Ridgeline plot*** (sometimes called ***Joyplot***) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. The distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of groups to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\n-   It works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n:::\n\n## Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using [ggridges](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/) package. The ggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: [`geom_ridgeline()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline.html) and [`geom_density_ridges()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_density_ridges.html). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\n\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted using `geom_density_ridges()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3, # scales height of ridgelines\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL,\n                   expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Varying colours along the x-axis\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved using [`geom_ridgeline_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html) or [`geom_density_ridges_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html). Both geoms work just like `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS, fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a \\\"raincloud\\\". The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does.\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created using functions provided by **ggdist** and **ggplot2** packages.\n\n## Plotting a Half-eye graph\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph using [`stat_halfeye()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_halfeye.html) of **ggdist** package. This produces a Half Eye visualisation, which contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = RACE, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nWe removed the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n:::\n\n## Adding boxplot with geom_boxplot()\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using [`geom_boxplot()`](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09.html) of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Adding dotplot with stat_dots()\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using [`stat_dots()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_dots.html) of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = \\\"left\\\" to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Finishing touch\n\nLastly, [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html) of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, `theme_economist()` of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
