In this exercise, we will learn two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Import and Launch R Packages\n\nThe following packages will be used in this exercise:\n\n-   **tidyverse** - a family of R packages for data science process,\n-   **ggridges** - a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, and\n-   **ggdist** - for visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggridges, ggdist, ggthemes, colorspace)\n```\n:::\n",
